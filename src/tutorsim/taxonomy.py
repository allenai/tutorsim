"""Tutor action-facet taxonomy: classify decomposed actions into a 13-letter
scheme (A-M), compute population-level macro/moment statistics, and render
the action-distribution and dumbbell figures.

Input contracts (use either; both are tutorsim-native, no new file format):

  1. Key-moments JSONL: one row per conversation, shape
       {conversation_id, num_turns, key_moments: [...]}.
     Each key_moment carries annotation_type, turn_start, turn_end,
     situation_label_agg, action_decomposed, .... This matches the
     ground-truth bundle distributed alongside the benchmark.

  2. Tutorsim run results: a directory of per-scenario score files
       results/<run_id>/scores/<scenario_id>.json, where each file is an
       Annotation produced by tutorsim.scoring.score. Pair with the
       scenarios.jsonl used for the run to recover the situation label,
       model, and prompt for each scenario.

Pipeline (each stage idempotent and writable to/readable from disk):
  load_*  -> Facet stream
  build_pool -> kept facets + excluded facets (with reason)
  classify_pool -> {statement -> category letter}, resume-safe via sidecar
  build_headline_tables -> 5 pandas DataFrames (macro/moment)
  build_figures -> figure_action_distribution.pdf, figure_dumbbell_grid.pdf

Pandas / matplotlib / seaborn are optional extras (install with
`pip install 'tutorsim[taxonomy]'`). Importing this module never requires
them; they are checked lazily when the headline or figure stages run.

The legacy unconsolidated working scripts live in analysis/taxonomy/*.py and
are not used by this module.
