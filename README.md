# Tutorsim

Tutorsim is a benchmark for measuring how well language models tutor. It runs a
model-under-test against a simulated student on frozen tutoring **moments**
(expert teacher-annotated key moments cut from real tutoring transcripts), then scores
the generated continuation. 

The implemented metrics are:
- Appropriate Scaffolding: How often does the LM tutor introduce scaffolds that make content more accessible in moments when expert teachers think that scaffolding should occur, without over-scaffolding
- Appropriate Rigor: How often does the LM tutor push for rigor by increasing the cognitive demands of the task in moments when expert teachers think that pushes for rigor should occur (without over-scaffolding)
- Avoids Over-Scaffolding: How often does the LM avoid introducing more supports than needed given the student's state?
- Action Taxonomy: How do the tutor's move differ from human tutor moves?

## Installation

Tutorsim requires Python 3.11 or newer. Install from a checkout:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .
```

This installs the `tutorsim` command and the `tutorsim` Python package — the
benchmark runtime. Everything a run depends on ships inside the package:
`src/tutorsim/default_config.yaml` and the tutor/student/scorer prompts under
`src/tutorsim/prompts/`.

## Running

TODO: Update the dataset path
Point the runner at the released Hugging Face dataset and provide an API key to
run the benchmark.

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...   # or the provider's key

tutorsim run \
  --tutors claude-opus-4-8 \
  --modes plain scaffolding_rigor \
  --sample 10 \
  --dataset <org>/tutorsim-transcripts-preview
```

Useful run options:

| Option | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--tutors MODEL_ID ...` | Tutor model IDs or registered custom tutor names to evaluate. |
| `--modes MODE ...` | Tutor prompt modes. Defaults to `plain scaffolding_rigor`. |
| `--dataset HF_ID` | Hugging Face dataset id (default: `dataset.id` from config). |
| `--data_path DIR` | Run from a local data dir; wins over `--dataset`. |
| `--dataset-revision REV` | Pin a HF dataset revision for reproducibility. |
| `--sample N` | Use the first `N` moments from the dataset. |
| `--trials N` | Run each tutor/mode cell multiple times and summarize mean/spread. |
| `--max-turns N` | Maximum generated tutor/student turns per conversation. |
| `--log-level LEVEL` | Log verbosity: `DEBUG`, `INFO` (default), `WARNING`, `ERROR`. |
| `--log-file FILE` | Optional combined log for the whole invocation (per-run logs are always written). |

Supported tutor prompt modes are:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| `plain` | Baseline tutor prompt. |
| `scaffolding_rigor` | Tutor prompt that explicitly targets scaffolding and rigor. |
| `oracle` | Reference-aware tutor prompt that requires a moment's reference transcript. |

Each run writes under `results/`. Re-running skips moments whose transcript and
score are already present. Partial failures are recorded in `summary.json`; a
run where zero moments complete raises an error and does not produce a
leaderboard-ready empty summary.

Run output layout:

```text
results/<run_id>/
  config.json
  run.log
  transcripts/<scenario_id>.json
  scores/<scenario_id>.json
  summary.json
  taxonomy/                 action-taxonomy classification: classified.csv + sidecars
```

Each run's `config.json` records the dataset source (id, revision or local
path, config name, record count, and the record-level content hash), the
resolved config, package version, git commit, config hash, prompt hashes, and
the dataset manifest when running from a local release dir. A run is
reproducible from: pinned dataset revision + content hash and the resolved
config (up to LLM sampling nondeterminism).

## Reports And Viewers

Aggregate completed run summaries into leaderboard files:

```bash
tutorsim report --results-root results --out leaderboard
```

This writes `leaderboard.md` and `leaderboard.csv`.

Build a self-contained HTML viewer:

```bash
tutorsim view --results-root results --out viewer.html
```

The report and viewer commands read `summary.json` files from run directories.

## Running new tutor models

No code changes are needed for hosted models: add a roster entry in your config
and export the provider API key. The provider is inferred from the model id
(`claude-*` → anthropic, `gpt-*` → openai, `gemini-*` → gemini,
`deepseek-ai/*` → together).

```yaml
models:
  my-new-model-id: { thinking: true, effort: high }
```

```bash
tutorsim run --tutors my-new-model-id --data_path <release dir>
```

Tutors are selectable per-run via the CLI. The Student model is set in the config; changing the student model would change the shape of the evaluation. Modify your 
config to swap the student model with another API-callable model:

```yaml
student: { model: claude-opus-4-6, mode: oracle, thinking: false } # default
```

## Custom Tutor / Student Models

You can register a different approach to the LM Tutor / Synthetic student,
for example a synthetic student without student-traits.

```python
from tutorsim import register_tutor, register_student

@register_tutor("my-tutor")
def my_tutor(conversation):
    return "next tutor turn"

@register_student("my-student")
def my_student(conversation):
    return "next student turn"
```

For CLI use, import the registration module before calling `tutorsim.cli.main()`
from a small wrapper script. There is not yet a plugin discovery mechanism.

Example wrapper:

```python
from tutorsim import register_tutor, register_student
from tutorsim.cli import main


@register_tutor("my-tutor")
def my_tutor(conversation):
    return "next tutor turn"


@register_student("my-student")
def my_student(conversation):
    return "next student turn"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then run the wrapper with normal CLI arguments, for example:

```bash
python my_tutorsim_wrapper.py run --tutors my-tutor --sample 1 --data_path <release dir>
```

## The dataset

The released dataset carries two representations of the same underlying data:

- **Source configs** for data consumers — `transcripts` (full sessions),
  `annotations` (human SAR annotations), `ground_truth` (labeled key moments).
- **`moments`** for eval runners — the frozen, self-contained runnable set
  (520 moments: 260 scaffolding / 260 rigor). Each record carries the pre-cut
  transcript context, gold dimension, the real human continuation (for the
  oracle student), the frozen student trait (the exact persona the paper's
  simulated student ran with — generated from the pre-cut prefix only, so
  every benchmark run everywhere evaluates against the same students), and
  full provenance back to the source transcripts. It is built once by
  maintainers and published; the runtime never constructs or regenerates any
  of it.

Validate a local release directory:

```bash
tutorsim-build dataset validate --data_path data/balanced_520_release
```

The release ships `moments.jsonl` with `moments.manifest.json` and
`moments.schema.json` beside it (flat, like the other release files — so a
full release download is itself a valid `--data_path` dir). The manifest
records the set name, version, schema version, record count,
a record-level `content_hash` (comparable across the HF and local load
paths), a file-level `file_sha256`, creation date, and provenance.


## Scoring

Tutorsim scores generated continuations with model-backed annotation passes and
then aggregates per-moment scores into leaderboard metrics:

| Metric | summary.json source | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Appropriate Scaffolding | `scaffold_calibrated.score` | Of scaffolding-appropriate moments, fraction where the tutor scaffolded without over-scaffolding. |
| Appropriate Rigor | `rigor_calibrated.score` | Of rigor-appropriate moments, fraction where the tutor pushed for rigor without over-scaffolding. |
| Avoids Over-Scaffolding | `1 - overscaffold.rate` | Fraction of all moments free of over-scaffolding. Computed at report time. |

These are the three metrics the paper reports; all are higher-is-better and
appear in the leaderboard as `appropriate_scaffolding`, `appropriate_rigor`,
and `avoids_overscaffold`.

## Action taxonomy

The action taxonomy classifies each decomposed tutor action into a 13-letter
scheme and produces the tables behind the paper's action-distribution figures.
The *data generation* lives in the runtime (`tutorsim.taxonomy` +
`tutorsim taxonomy`); the *figures* are rendered by the notebooks under
`analysis/working-paper-*`, which import `from tutorsim import taxonomy`.

**Every `tutorsim run` classifies its own LM-side actions** — alongside the
headline metrics — writing `results/<run_id>/taxonomy/classified.csv` and a
`taxonomy` block (raw category counts) into `summary.json`. This adds an LLM
classification pass per run (model set by the `taxonomy` config block, default
`claude-opus-4-8`); it is resume-safe and never fails the run.

The comparison figures plot each LM against a fixed **human reference**
distribution. That reference is the paper's frozen, published distribution —
[`analysis/working-paper-20260630/v1_action_taxonomy_distribution.csv`](analysis/working-paper-20260630/v1_action_taxonomy_distribution.csv)
— so you do **not** re-classify the ground truth; the figure notebooks load it
by default via `tutorsim.taxonomy.read_paper_distribution(...)`. Only the LM
side comes from your run. Rendering the figures needs pandas + matplotlib —
install the `analysis` extra:

```bash
pip install -e ".[analysis]"
```

Then point a figure notebook's `LM_CLASSIFIED` at your run's
`results/<run_id>/taxonomy/classified.csv` and run it — the human baseline is
already wired to the paper distribution.

Regenerating (optional): to rebuild the human reference from scratch, or to
produce the full headline tables from classified facets:

```bash
# Regenerate the human reference from the ground-truth bundle:
tutorsim taxonomy classify --kind key_moments --input key_moments.jsonl --output ./human

# Re-classify a completed run's LM side (normally emitted by the run itself):
tutorsim taxonomy classify --kind tutorsim --input results/<run_id>/ \
  --scenarios data/balanced_520_release/moments.jsonl --output ./lm

# Headline tables from classified facets (needs a classified human side):
tutorsim taxonomy headline --human ./human/classified.csv --lm ./lm/classified.csv --output ./headline
```

## Repository Layout

├── src/tutorsim/            installable benchmark runtime

The core rule: code needed to run or score the benchmark lives in
`src/tutorsim/`; code that creates the dataset lives in `tutorsim_build/`;
code that explains or visualizes results lives in `analysis/`. Build and
analysis code may import the runtime; the runtime never imports them.

## Configuration

Tutorsim loads config in this order:

1. `tutorsim run --config path/to/config.yaml`
2. `TUTORSIM_CONFIG`
3. `./config.yaml`
4. packaged `src/tutorsim/default_config.yaml`

Use `configs/local.example.yaml` as a starting point for local overrides.

Config files have these top-level sections:

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dataset` | Released benchmark source: `id` (HF dataset), `revision` (pin), `config` (which config holds the runnable moments; default `moments`). |
| `providers` | Maps provider names to the environment variable that contains the API key. |
| `models` | Model roster for hosted tutor models. The provider is inferred from the model ID. |
| `student` | Hosted model and mode used for the simulated student. |
| `scorer` | Hosted model used for the scoring passes. |
| `defaults` | Default `trials` and `max_turns` values for `tutorsim run`. |
| `retry` | Retry behavior for direct model calls. |
| `batch` | Batch API polling timeout for scorer/provider paths that use batch APIs. |


## Logging

Both CLIs (`tutorsim` and `tutorsim-build`) log progress to the console at
INFO level, and every run automatically writes its own log file — nothing to
enable:

- `tutorsim run` writes `results/<run_id>/run.log` per cell, next to
  `config.json` and `summary.json`. The run directory is the complete record
  of the run: what ran, what was resumed, and which moments failed.
- `tutorsim-build dataset build` / `build-from-run` / `build-ground-truth`
  write a `build.log` into their output directory (skipped on `--dry-run`).

Log files append, so a resumed run continues the same log. In a multi-tutor
sweep, parallel lanes each write only to their own run's log, and every
console line is tagged with its cell (e.g. `[gpt-5-4/plain]`) so interleaved
lanes stay readable. Logs narrate the two phases of each run: Replay
(generating tutor/student continuations) and Classification (the 3-pass
batch scorer).

Two optional knobs: `--log-level DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR` controls
verbosity, and `--log-file FILE` additionally writes one combined log for the
whole invocation — useful for watching a sweep across lanes, or for the
subcommands without an output directory (`report`, `view`, `validate`).
`TUTORSIM_LOG_LEVEL` / `TUTORSIM_LOG_FILE` environment variables set defaults
for the flags.

## Development

Maintainer extras (not needed to run the benchmark):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"                    # + pytest (runtime tests)
pip install -e ".[build,build-dev]"        # + dataset construction tooling
pip install -e ".[analysis]"               # + pandas/matplotlib for analysis figures
```

Run from a local directory

```
tutorsim run \
  --tutors claude-opus-4-8 \
  --modes plain scaffolding_rigor \
  --sample 10 \
  --data_path data/balanced_520_release
```

Run the runtime test suite without real API calls:

```bash
pytest tests/tutorsim -q          # runtime only (needs [dev])
pytest tests -q                   # full suite (needs [dev,build-dev,analysis]; missing extras skip)
```


### Dataset construction (maintainers)

Dataset construction lives in `tutorsim_build/` — outside the runtime package,
because changing it can change the benchmark itself. Install with the `build`
extra and use the `tutorsim-build` CLI:

```bash
# Raw human annotations -> per-conversation ground-truth JSON (LLM batch pipeline)
tutorsim-build dataset build-ground-truth --input <annotations.jsonl> --labeller hybrid

# Ground truth + transcripts + id list -> release dir (moments.jsonl + manifest)
tutorsim-build dataset build \
  --set balanced_520 \
  --ids tutorsim_build/balanced_520_ids.json \
  --ground-truth <ground-truth dir> \
  --transcripts <transcripts dir> \
  --tutoring-provider-a-jsonl <transcripts.jsonl> \
  --out data/balanced_520_release \
  --created 2026-07-01

# Rebuild the paper's exact 520 from the published reference run
# (the canonical record of the benchmark-time detections)
tutorsim-build dataset build-from-run \
  --set balanced_520 \
  --reference-run <benchmark_520_full_run.jsonl> \
  --tutoring-provider-a-jsonl <transcripts.jsonl> \
  --ids tutorsim_build/balanced_520_ids.json \
  --out data/balanced_520_release \
  --created 2026-07-01
```

`tutorsim_build/balanced_520_ids.json` is the canonical, frozen selection of
the paper's 520 moments (committed; deidentified UUID surrogates only). The
selection is not derivable — the sampler that chose it predates this repo —
so the id list plus the published reference run are the reproduction path.
