"""Tests for over-scaffolding decomposition caching in build_ground_truth.py.

Over-scaffolding decomposition works like action/result decomposition: a content
hash keys the cache so a moment is reused when unchanged and re-decomposed when
its text changes. The over-scaffold prompt reads situation + action + result, so
its key must hash all three (unlike action_decompose_key, which hashes only the
action). These tests pin that down.
